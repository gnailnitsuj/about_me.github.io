    <h1> Who Am I? </h1> <hr>
    <p> Hello! My name is Justin. I am currently a rising senior at Brooklyn College,
        studying Information Systems with a minor concentration in Multimedia Computing.
        I've always had an undying passion for tech ever since childhood, and persistently
        immersing myself within the industry. As for more professional experiences, I have
        collaborated with numerous projects such as being an AI tester for a coaching
        consultant, mPath-AI. Additionally, I've worked with groups to develop more of the 
        front-end functionalities of websites. Programming languages I have experience with
        are: Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JS, SQL. Moving on from the mundane parts about me,
        some of my hobbies consist of playing guitar, piano, games, and exercising. 
        I love playing volleyball, badminton, rock climbing, and biking. I am
        someone that has a hard time keeping still both physically and mentally, so 
        I tend to juggle new hobbies into the mix. 
    </p> <br>
    <p> Thank you for taking the time to read this!</p> <hr>
